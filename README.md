#  The Analysis
Each query in this project was crafted to answer a specific business question for the KMS retail company. Below is an overview of how I approached each question and the corresponding SQL logic.

## 1. Top Product Category
```sql
SSELECT TOP 1 Product_Category, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM KMS
GROUP BY Product_Category
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
```
- **Category:** Technology
- **Action:** Increase inventory and marketing budget for Technology products.





##  Key Insights
- **Top Product Category:** Technology had the highest total sales.
- **Regional Performance:** East and West regions lead in revenue; Central region underperformed.
- **Shipping Cost:** Express Air is the most expensive method but often used for low-priority orders.
- **Customer Value:** High-value customers primarily buy Technology and Office Supplies.
- **Returns Analysis:** Certain customers returned multiple items, impacting profit.
---

##  Recommendations
- **Match shipping method to priority:** Use Express Air for high-priority orders only.  
- **Boost low-performing regions:** Target promotions in Central region.  
- **Engage low-value customers:** Loyalty programs or bundle offers.  
- **Focus on profitable categories:** Increase marketing for Technology and Office Supplies.
